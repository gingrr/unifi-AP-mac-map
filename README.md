# unifi-AP-mac-map
A lightweight Bash utility for auditing UniFi Access Points over SSH and extracting their true 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio MAC addresses, independent of the UniFi Controller (which only reports the MAC for the ethernet port, and it's also notrious for being inaccurate). Designed for field engineers and network admins who need accurate MAC verification directly from the AP firmware.
